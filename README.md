## Overview
This is a Todo application that's built with a mobile first workflow, encorporating HTML, CSS, CSS variables, Flexbox and Javascript(ES6). It also allows usrers to toggle between light/dark mode.  

### Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
